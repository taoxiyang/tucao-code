# Tucao Code!

* Tucaoable Code
* 值得吐槽的代码
* ツッコミすべきコード

From time to time, you see some badly written code, or code written in
a funny way, and you lol, and you let it go.  Why not collect such
tucao-able code and make everyone lol?

## What is "tucao"?
You 吐槽 (Tu Cao) something when you feel you must make a comment.
Especially when you see something extraordinarily funny or
embarassing or something.
